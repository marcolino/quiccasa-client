Agnita: Authentication for Create React App using AWS Cognito
 - https://levelup.gitconnected.com/agnita-authentication-for-create-react-app-using-aws-cognito-80cde1fb781b

Security practices
 - .env files are excluded by git repositories; .env.gpg files are not;
   when adding some secret to .env, crypt it with yarn env-crypt;
   it can be later decrypted with `yarn env-decrypt`.
